Hey there my friends!

RodolfoMP here. I like to do stuff whit computers (or at least trying to) 
At this moment i'm way below average in terms of coding and desining, but i'm learning new things and feeling really excited about what is far away in the future for me.
So prepare yourself world, nobory can stop me now!
